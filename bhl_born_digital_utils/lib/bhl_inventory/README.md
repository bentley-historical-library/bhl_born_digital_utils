> The "Title" element will be used to describe intellectual entities (such as a Series or Subseries) as well as actual manifestations of archival materials (Instances or Digital Objects).  As such, it should provide researchers and reference staff with a clear and unambiguous idea of the nature and scope of materials. 

> Avoid jargon or idiosyncratic terms in Title elements and be sure that abbreviations are spelled out. 

> Avoid describing content as "miscellaneous". - BHL Curation Manual
